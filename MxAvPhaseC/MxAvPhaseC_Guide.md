# About
This is a draft user manual for the MaxPhase and AvPhase codes.

# Main steps
The input data to be analyzed must be provided in the form of HDF5 files. The output of the analysis is also stored in HDF5 files. You can see the format of an input data file in TESTPERFEVALOMP/noise1.hdf5. Matlab codes have been provided in RAAPTR/GENSIMDATA to generate simulated data. A .mat file generated by these codes can be converted to the required HDF5 file using the Matlab code 'mpavinfile2hdf5.m' in RAAPTR/MxAvPhaseC.  Similarly, RAAPTR/MxAvPhaseC/mpavoutfile2mat.m can be used to convert the output HDF5 file to .mat file.

Besides the input data file, an HDF5 file containing the search parameters must be provided. Again, codes have been provided in RAAPTR/GENSIMDATA to generate a search parameter file and convert it into an HDF5 file. 

# Search parameters for PSO
By using **parameters.m** file we generate two parameter files, **Sim_Params_X.mat** file is for simulation while the other **searchParams_simDataSKA_X.mat** file contains the search range of PSO, users can change the **xmaxmin** value in **parameters.m** file to change the corresponding value in PSO.
Here's the meaning of **xmaxmin**:
It is a 7x2 matrix with the first column is the max value and second is min value.
xmaxmin(1,:): alpha
xmaxmin(2,:): delta
xmaxmin(3,:): angular velocity --omega for GW
xmaxmin(4,:): initial phase
xmaxmin(5,:): amplitude in sec
xmaxmin(6,:): inclination
xmaxmin(7,:): polarization

# Run on LS5
First on LS5 load the module use

```
ml gcc/5.2.0
ml gsl/2.2.1
```

to compile the code.

For running a job use

```
ml gsl/2.2.1
ml launcher
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=8
```

## Create the LAUNCHER JOB FILE
The format of the line is:

```
<executable> <path-to-parameter-file>
<path-to-input-data-file> <path-to-output-folder>
<option: maxPhase or AvPhase>
```

Here is an example of a single line of the job file:

```
~/PULSARTIMING/MaxPhaseC/perfeval_spmd.out
/work/02580/soumya/lonestar/PULSARTIMING/
searchParams_simDataSKA.hdf5
/work/02580/soumya/lonestar/PULSARTIMING/
simDataSKA_snr0123_loc3_HDF5/noise25.hdf5
/work/02580/soumya/lonestar/PULSARTIMING/
simDataSKA_snr0123_loc3_HDF5/results_run2/noise25.hdf5
maxPhase
```

To submit a job to LS5 you should creat a slurm file, here is an example.
**LAUNCHER_SLURM_FILE_PTA.slurm**

```
#!/bin/bash

#

# Simple SLURM script for submitting multiple serial

# jobs (e.g. parametric studies) using a script wrapper

# to launch the jobs.

#

# To use, build the launcher executable and your

# serial application(s) and place them in your WORKDIR

# directory.  Then, edit the CONTROL_FILE to specify  

# each executable per process.

#SBATCH -J PTA_MultiSrc_SKA_mxp_Apr12_2017
         (This is the name of the job)

#SBATCH -N 166 (This is the number of nodes requested.
                Each node on LS5 has 24 processors.)

#SBATCH -n 498 (This is the number of jobs to
  run = number of lines in the LAUNCHER job file.
  With 8 parallel PSO runs per data file,
  we can process 24/8 = 3 data files on each node.
  Hence the number of nodes is 498/3 = 166.)

#SBATCH -p normal (This is the type of queue requested.
  Do not change this.)

#SBATCH -o PTA_Apr12_2017_3.o%j (This is the output file
  where any screen output will be redirected.)

#SBATCH -e PTA_Apr12_2017_3.e%j (This is the file
  where error messages from LAUNCHER will be logged.
  Important for diagnostics if a job fails.)

#SBATCH -t 3:00:00 (Time requested for the job.
  Should be slightly in excess of the anticipated
  completion time of all the jobs. However,
  if any one node hangs, all nodes will wait
  until this time limit is reached and the
  SUs consumed will correspondingly be higher!
  So, it should not be too much higher than the
  anticipated completion time.)

#SBATCH --mail-user=soumya.mohanty@utrgv.edu
(Email address where alerts will be sent by sbatch.)

#SBATCH --mail-type=all
